# UFO-sightings
# Purpose of project
The purpose of this project was to build a webpage that offers a user an ability to filter through results for targeted UFO sightings. 

# Results

Performing a search for the images utilized in the website required me to go directly to the image and save it as a jpg. Once saved, I imported the image into the code in order to display on the site. 

# Summary

Drawbacks of the site: My site in particular seems to be a bit bland, perhaps more artistic features would help spruce the site up & make it more visually appealing. 

Recommendations for further development: Add more visual features, perhaps shadows for the filter buttons as well as add some external links to the site for people to find more data.
